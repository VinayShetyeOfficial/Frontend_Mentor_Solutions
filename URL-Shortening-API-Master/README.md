## What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained valuable experience in building interactive web applications, working with APIs, and implementing advanced features. Specific areas of learning included:

- Fetching data from a third-party API using JavaScript.
- Integrating API responses into the user interface dynamically.
- Implementing client-side form validation.
- Handling asynchronous operations and promises.
- Optimizing performance by leveraging browser caching and code splitting techniques.

## Continued Development

Moving forward, I aim to further enhance my skills in building robust and scalable web applications. I plan to explore more advanced JavaScript topics, such as state management libraries like React or Vue, and delve deeper into API design and development.

## API

This project utilizes the [apilayer.com](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/short_url-api) API for URL shortening functionality. The API documentation can be found [here](https://apilayer.com/docs).
