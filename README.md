This repository contains my solutions to various web page design challenges from Frontend Mentor. Each challenge focuses on different aspects of front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and  Jav aScript.    
               
## Challenges Completed       
1. **Huddle Landing Page:** A responsive landing page built using semantic HTML and CSS. It features a clean design with a call-to-action section.   
2. **Multi-Step Form:** An interactive multi-step form that guides users through a series of input fields. JavaScript is used to handle form validation and navigation. 
3. **News Homepage:** A news homepage layout with sections for top stories, categories, and featured articles. Flexbox and responsive design techniques are applied.
4. **QR Code Design:** A creative QR code design using HTML and CSS. The QR code is styled to match the overall theme of the page.
5. **Results Summary Component:** A summary component that displays results or statistics. It includes dynamic data and responsive styling. 
6. **URL Shortening API Master:** A landing page for a URL shortening service. Users can input long URLs and receive shortened versions. JavaScript is used to interact with an API.
