### Built With

## What I Learned

I learned a lot while building this landing page. I experimented with CSS custom properties for the first time and found them to be incredibly useful for managing design variables. Additionally, implementing a mobile-first workflow helped me ensure that the page looks great on all screen sizes. Overall, this project helped me solidify my understanding of responsive design principles.

## Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my JavaScript skills and exploring more advanced CSS techniques. I also plan to delve deeper into accessibility practices to ensure that my websites are usable by everyone. 

Feel free to customize the content and structure according to your preferences. Happy coding! üòä
